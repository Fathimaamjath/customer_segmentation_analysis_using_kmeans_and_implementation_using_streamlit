# customer_segmentation_analysis_using_kmeans_and_implementation_using_streamlit

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

To develop a web application using streamlit for customer segmentation analysis using kmeans algorithm.

Customer segmentation is grouping customers based on characteristics such as age, annual income, spending score.
It helps the organization to understand the customer, knowing the difference between the customer groups help them to make strategic decision regarding product growth and marketing.
The oppurtunities of customer segmentation are endless, it totally depends upon the customerdata that we use.

In this project we are using mallcustomer.csv dataset which is available in kaggle.
In this dataset we can see every features are independent of each other. we don't know what to predict. this dataset is a perfect example for unsupervised learning.

Our aim is to group certain customers into a specific category, such that these group shares a common behaviour that helps us to make some plan of action.
For achieving this we are using kmeans algorithm, so that at the end we will create a dependent variable with finite number of values which refers to the classes/group were each customer belongs.
